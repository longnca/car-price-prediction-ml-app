# Car Price Prediction

In this project, I want to build a machine learning model to predict car prices. I compare two models, linear regression and gradient boosting models, and then select the one with the highest performance to build a web app. I also applied object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to this project, such as encapsulating functions as methods. The project is still in progress.
